# Weather Forecast App Documentation
## Introduction
Welcome to the Weather Forecast App documentation! This project is designed to provide users with up-to-date weather information for their location. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app retrieves data from a weather API and displays it in an easy-to-understand format. This documentation aims to provide detailed explanations of the code, along with images illustrating the program's execution and user interactions.
## Features
1. **Current Weather**: Displays the current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description.
2. **Forecast**: Provides a 5-day weather forecast, including minimum and maximum temperatures, along with weather descriptions.
3. **Location-based**: Automatically detects the user's location using geolocation API or allows manual input of location.
4. **Responsive Design**: Ensures the app is accessible and user-friendly across different devices and screen sizes.
## Implementation Overview
The Weather Forecast App is implemented using three primary technologies:
- **HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)**: Defines the structure and content of the web page.
- **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**: Styles the appearance of the app, ensuring a visually appealing and intuitive interface.
- **JavaScript**: Fetches weather data from the API, processes it, and dynamically updates the UI to display the information.
## Code Explanation
### HTML Structure
The HTML structure of the Weather Forecast App consists of the following components:
- `<header>`: Contains the app title and possibly the search bar for manual location input.
- `<main>`: Main content area where weather information is displayed.
- `<footer>`: Footer section with attribution and additional information.
### CSS Styling
The CSS stylesheet defines the visual appearance of the app, including layout, colors, fonts, and animations. Key CSS styles include:
- Styling for header, main content area, footer, and individual weather cards.
- Responsive design to adapt the layout for different screen sizes.
- Customization of fonts, colors, and backgrounds to enhance the app's visual appeal.
### JavaScript Functionality
The JavaScript code provides the functionality and interactivity of the app. Key JavaScript functions include:
- **`fetchWeatherData()`:** Retrieves weather data from a weather API based on the user's location.
- **`displayCurrentWeather()`:** Renders the current weather information on the screen.
- **`displayWeatherForecast()`:** Displays the 5-day weather forecast.
- **`handleLocationInput()`:** Handles user input for location and triggers weather data fetching.
- **`updateUI()`:** Updates the UI with weather data fetched from the API.
- **`handleErrors()`:** Handles errors that may occur during data fetching or processing.
### API Integration
The Weather Forecast App integrates with a weather API to retrieve weather data. The app makes HTTP requests to the API endpoints, receives JSON-formatted responses, and parses the data to extract relevant information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather descriptions.
